# Script for the game 'It is not real'

This README.md shows all the parts published on Github and their respective meaning. For mode detailed description go to each directory. 


## scripts

A folder holding all the scripts in the project. All of them are written in C#. File names use 	snake_case and programs use camelCase. 
Warning: There is a lot of static variables as of now, which could bring some problems later on. Unity tends to like overwrite static variables out of nowhere. So later on, it "might" re-done. 


## models

A folder holding 3D models used in the project. As of now, there are only some basic models and a lot of them is still missing (as in â€“ they are not done yet). Models are made in Blender and exported in .fbx format. They use Palette found in a video that seems to be deleted...? It can't be found on Youtube anymore. 


## dialogues

A folder that holds all the dialogue in the game. It has structure on its own, with more directories with their own purposes and names.
