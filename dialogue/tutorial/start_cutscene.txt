Oh...!
Hello there, little one.
You are finally awake. Good.
That certainly didn't took me forever to do... 
A-ny-way!
Now that you are all patched up and ready to go, I will tell you what to do.
You thought you won't be doing anything?
Lol. Stupid.
I bought you so you can gather me resources. 
... What was it? 
For what? 
Well- 
Uh-
...
Don't ask stupid questions. Just work.
You will learn it later.
See that tree over there? Go on, cut it.
How? 
Oh my god, I thought you ought to be smart.
Didn't the ad said you have 3000 IQ?
... Well, nevermind.
Just hold left mouse button over the tree you want to cut.
Go on, try it.
